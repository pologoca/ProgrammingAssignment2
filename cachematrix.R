## Caching the Inverse Matrix:

## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some 
## benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly.
## Below are a pair of functions that are used to create a special object that 
## stores a matrix and caches its inverse.

## The next function creates a matrix object that can cache its inverse.


makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  inv <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    inv <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setInverse <- function(inverse) inv <<- inverse
  getInverse <- function() inv
  list(set = set,
       get = get,
       setInverse = setInverse,
       getInverse = getInverse)
}

## The function below computes the inverse of the matrix created by makeCacheMatrix. 
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
## then it should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  inv <- x$getInverse()
  if (!is.null(inv)) {
    return(inv)
  }
  mat <- x$get()
  inv <- solve(mat, ...)
  x$setInverse(inv)
  inv
}
